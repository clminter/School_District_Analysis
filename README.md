# School_District_Analysis
### Overivew
##### Using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Numpy in Python an in-depth analysis of the school district was performed.
#### Challenges:
* Identifying data anomolies and making corrections.
* Pushing files successfully with GitBash.
* Discovering evidence of tampering with the data and making necessary adjustments to still deliver reliable results.
### Results
#### Affect on the District Summary
##### * Post Evidence Adjustment
